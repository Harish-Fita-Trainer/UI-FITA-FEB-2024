                <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
                <p>Anna University (Chennai) comprises four colleges - the principal seat College of Engineering, Guindy (CEG, Guindy Campus), Alagappa College of Technology (ACT, Guindy Campus), Madras Institute of Technology (MIT, Chromepet Campus) and School of Architecture and Planning (SAP, Guindy Campus).
                    The first version of Anna University was formed in 1978 and various governments changed the varsity's structure and affiliation scope repeatedly. In 2001, under the Anna University Amendment Act of 2001, the erstwhile Anna University became an affiliating university, taking under its wings all the engineering colleges in Tamil Nadu. This included six government engineering colleges, three government-aided private institutions, and 426 self-financed colleges. On 1 February 2007, as a result of a Government of Tamil Nadu decision, the university was split into six constituent universities: Anna University, Chennai; Anna University of Technology, Chennai; Anna University of Technology, Tiruchirappalli; Anna University of Technology, Coimbatore; Anna University of Technology Tirunelveli and Anna University of Technology, Madurai.[4] The institutes were formally created in 2010. On 14 September 2011 during period of Ex CM Jayalalitha, a bill was passed to re-merge the universities.[5] The merger was finalized in August 2012.[6]       
                    In 2011 and 2012 the constituents colleges were merged back to a single affiliating university and the four regional universities continue to function as a regional campus of the university.
                    Admissions
                    A common entrance test – the Tamil Nadu Professional Courses Entrance Examination (TNPCEE) – was used as a basis for admission to professional courses in the state until 2006.[7] Starting in the academic year 2007–08, students were admitted to engineering colleges on the basis of their higher secondary marks.[8] Post-graduate admission process is carried out through TANCET and GATE scores.[9]                    
                    Academics
                    The university offers courses in engineering and technology through its affiliated colleges and follows a dual semester system. Every year the university conducts examinations for the even semester in May–June and for an odd semester in November–December.[10][11][12
